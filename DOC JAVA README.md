## Introduction
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It is widely used for developing secure, scalable, and robust applications. 
Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows programs to execute on different operating systems without modification.

## Why Java?

Java is widely used because:
- It is platform independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
- Provides strong security features
- Suitable for large-scale and enterprise applications
- Has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
- Strong community and long-term industry support

## History 

Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. 
The project was initially called Oak and was intended for programming consumer electronic devices such as set-top boxes and televisions.
In 1995, Oak was renamed Java and officially released. With the rapid growth of the internet, Java gained popularity because of its ability to run the same program on different platforms using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
In 2010, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which became the official maintainer of Java. 
Since then, Java has continued to evolve with regular updates and is widely used in enterprise applications, web development, mobile (Android), and cloud-based systems.
